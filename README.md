Below graph shows the output of the ac analysis




# Transient Analysis
Go to simulate select transient analysis set the stop time as 1ms and run the simulation ,The below graph shows the output of transient analysis



# INFERENCE
.For a differential amplifier to work properly, you need to set the MOSFETs in their active region (saturation region for long-channel MOSFETs). This typically involves proper sizing of resistors, current sources, and gate voltages
. Varry the MOSFET length and width (m1&m2)get calculated id current in dc analysis
.set the Ac amplitude as 1 in the ac analysis
. From the frequency response, you can determine the bandwidth of the differential amplifier by identifying the frequency
# RESULT
.By varrying Mosfet width and length we get id current 0.45mA
m1 and m2 L=180nm w=7.8nm
.RSS value 777ohm and rd=3.3kohm
